# Hermes
Hermes provides standardized response wrappers for ASP.NET APIs. It offers generic Response&lt;T>, ID-based IdResponse&lt;T>, and paginated PagedResponse&lt;T> types with extensible metadata attributes. Factory methods ensure consistent API responses across your application, simplifying serialization and client consumption.
